Cliff Notes:
-Discovered misconfigured FTP server allowing anonymous FTP
-Uploaded php reverse shell to FTP directory
-The FTP directory was accessible via the webserver running on the same host
-Run reverse shell via browser
-This gets a foothold into the server as www-data user
-Discovered interesting directory named incidents which contained a pcap file
-Exfil the pcap file by simply moving it to the FTP directory and pulling it via web
-Reviewed pcap file and found what looks like someone else previously exploiting the same server
-Continued digging through pcap and found where previous intruder had attempted to elevate permissions and the password that goes with that
-YOLO tried this password with another account discovered after viewing /etc/passwd via SSH
-Got logged in as user lennie
-Discovered some scripts owned by root in lennies home directory.
-One of these scripts called another script in /etc/ named print.sh
-print.sh is owned by...Lennie...BINGO
-edited print.sh to contain a reverse shell
-waited for root to eventually run the script in lennies home directory
-got root flag
-went to bed
